# BITWISE
## AIM
To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators

## THEORY
Bitwise operators are fundamental tools in computer programming that allow manipulation of individual bits within binary representations of data. Here's a brief overview of the key concepts:

1. Types of bitwise operators:
   - AND (&)

   - OR (|)
   - XOR (^)
   - NOT (~)
   - Left shift (<<)
   - Right shift (>>)

2. These operators work directly on the binary representation of numbers.

3. They are often used for:
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Low-level device control
   - Cryptography and hashing
   - Optimization in certain algorithms

4. Bitwise operations are typically faster than arithmetic operations.

5. They can be used to perform various tasks like setting/clearing specific bits, checking if a number is odd/even, or multiplying/dividing by powers of 2.

## CODE
## OUTPUT
# CONCLUSION

learnt how use bitwise operators in C++.
